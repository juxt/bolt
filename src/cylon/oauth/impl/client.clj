;; What I was saying was, in summary, that OpenID/Connect layers on top of OAuth2 - but in doing so complects the two processes: the first process (OAuth2) is responsible for authenticating the client application (let's call this Astro, a web ui for managing iot devices)
;; Alice is a user. She is using Astro to manage her azondi devices. The Oauth2 process is authenticating that Astro is a valid application.

;; But this isn't authorization - this is authentication
;; can you write?
;; > sorry; I thnk it can be renamed to : start-app-grant-workflow
;; this fn encapsulates this kind of knowledge,, related to how start this process, where to go to grant the app privileges , so it has to be redirected , but doesn't check any value related to authentication there is not conditional here

;; yes, but I would argue that this is still an authentication process which results in an access token
;; an access token doesn't let you do anything, you must be authorized first
;; the access token is a parameter into the authorizer
;; authentication process results in a) user's identity b) an access token
;; but the first step is totally independent of the second step
;; both a) and b) are the results of a single workflow - the OAuth2 with OpenID/Connect layered on it
;; i don't think so :)
;; but we wouldn't run the oauth2 process (code exchange) twice - once for the user identity and another time for the access token - they are both established together using a single workflow
; yes this is right , but i think that we are a bit mixing 2 workflows
;; authn and authz will happen at the same time - you're right
;; process A: it's really authn and partial authz, because
;; process B is the completion of the authz step
;; process B can assume that the access token is real and authentic.
;; process B can also trust that the scopes associated with the access token are accurate and authentic
;; process B can still choose to deny the user access to the resource, if the access token does not correspond to sufficient scopes
;; so this discussion, is relaly about what to name this function
;; and I don't think authorize captures the meaning
;; process A: it's really authn and partial authz, because
;; it would be more accurate to name this function 'process A'
;; (but that would be silly)
;; so I think we should name it authenticate because that captures more precisely (although not 100% accurately) what the process does
;; but later we will run process B and that will be called authorization

;; why don't you name it (defn grant app req)
;; i think that really represents the fact or the start moment that the resource-owner grants the client to access the resource-server
;; ok
;; great!
;; i see
;; i'm going to the toilet )
;; :)
;; these comments wil be saved in github perhaps :)
;; i'm getting coffee - i think you're right

;; So this function does not belong in client.clj - it belongs in auth-server authorization.clj
